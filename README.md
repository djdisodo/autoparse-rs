# autoparse
you can make parser easier using derive macro

though it helps you make a parser without writing a bunch of code it doesn't guarantee your parser is complete

also check `autoparse-general`

## goals
- [x] minimal parsing 
- [x] derive macro
- [ ] lossless/lossy parsing
- [ ] support indenting
- [ ] support span
